        2. Description of the di.me userware and the operation of di.me servers
    </h3>
    <p>
        2.1 di.me is a software prototype that Fraunhofer provides to generate, evaluate, and demonstrate research results in the field of social networking. The
        user can use di.me as decentralized, privacy-friendly network. di.me can be operated on several servers. The user’s posted or uploaded data are stored only
        on the server that the user has registered to, or on servers other users have registered to these users are contacted. di.me has the following features and
        functionalities: di.me
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            is a decentrally organized social network that can be used to exchange and share profiles, messages, and data,
            offers an own access (“personal service”) for each user that is technically separated from those of other users
        </li>
        <li>
            is under the full control of the user who only decides who gets access to which information. No third party gets undesired access to a user’s data
        </li>
        <li>
            can be accessed by the internet or the Android application “di.me mobile”,
        </li>
        <li>
            manages data from different user devices on the server that the user has registered to
        </li>
        <li>
            enables to connect to information from other social networks, e.g. messages, liveposts, profiles, or contacts of the user. Connected information from
            other networks are updated regularly;
        </li>
        <li>
            gives recommendations to data privacy and trust,
        </li>
        <li>
            is an intelligent system that can analyse the situation of the user, e.g. to show which contacts of the user are nearby
        </li>
        <li>
            runs decentralized on several servers, e.g. the server dime.hci.iao.fraunhofer.de provided by Fraunhofer
        </li>
        <li>
            allows the user to select a server for registering, or to host an own server
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        2.2 di.me is developed by the research project digital.me that is funded by the European Union (grant agreement FP7/2007- 2013, n° 257787).
        www.dime-project.eu. Partner of the project are: Fraunhofer IAO (DE) (Koordination), AMETIC (ES), Barcelona Digital (ES), CAS Software AG (DE), National
        University of Galway (IRL), Universität Siegen (DE), Telecom Italia (IT), Yellowmap GmbH (DE).
    </p>
    <p>
        2.3 Fraunhofer provides by its institute Fraunhofer IAO the server dime.hci.iao.fraunhofer.de as test-operation of the di.me. The test operation is planned
        for &lt;01.07.2013&gt; until 31.12.2013.
    </p>
    <p>
        The objective of the test operation is to give access to the research results of the project digital.me. The project wants to collect feedback from test
        users in order to optimize the software. Further, the test operation shall demonstrate the development state of the open-source-software which shall be
        published at a later development state. For the test-operation, the software was provided with additional functions and services. The test operation is not
        intended to provide a service which can be used for other purposes than the above stated. The test operation has no commerical interests.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides the server dime.hci.iao.fraunhofer.de, the project partners offer further test servers (see www.dimetrials.bdigital.org). The users of all test-servers can get into
        contact via a user directory (the “di.me user directory”).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>3. Usage rights</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        3.1 The user receives a simple right to use the provided state of di.me for the function as intended in the program code. This right is simple, limited in
        time to the duration of this usage contract, and can be revoked any time. There is no right to manipulate, distribute, transmit, or sublicence. Later,
        di.me shall be provided under the open-source-licence for the European Union (EUPL v.1.1).

    </p>
    <h3>
        6. Warranty, Liability
    </h3>
    <p>
        6.1 The user knows that the development and operation of di.me and of the optional Android application “di.me mobile client” is a research project which
        provides prototypical systems but no products ready for market. The software is only provided in the currently available, non-tested development state,
        free of charge as it is.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because of that, Fraunhofer excludes any warranty for merchantable quality or deficiency in title of di.me, its operation, and the optional Android application
        “di.me mobile” that can be installed on the user’s personal devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        In particular, any warranty is excluded for
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            that the test-server or di.me or the Android application “di.me mobile” is available any time and permanently, and
        </li>
        <li>
            that the installation and operation of the di.me Android app has no negative effects on other software of the Android device or on the data saved on it
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        6.2 Fraunhofer is liable only in the cases of intention, gross negligence, damages caused to body and life, and under the regulation of the
        Produkthaftungsgesetz (product liability law). In particular this applies for damages caused by the use of di.me or the Android App “di.me mobile” and/or
        the misuse of them, also by third parties. Any other liability is excluded.
    </p>
    <p>
        In particular, Fraunhofer does not assume any liability for
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            the content of registered users. Only the registered users are responsible for content that is delivered by them to the system or published to third
            parties. Fraunhofer does not control or influence the activities of users or the content provided by users and is not responsible for it. Nevertheless,
            Fraunhofer reserves the right to delete content and to prohibit users from further use of the service at our own discretion, especially in cases where
            posted content contravenes the law or is deemed incompatible with the objectives of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.
        </li>
        <li>
            the content for the contents of linked external websites which are under only under the responsibility of their providers. They are also not controlled
            by Fraunhofer.
        </li>
        <li>
            the accuracy, completeness or topicality of any of the content presented
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        7. Final provision
    </h3>
    <p>
        7.1 Should a provision of this contract prove to be wholly or partly void or should the contract have omissions, this shall not affect the validity of the
        remaining provisions. The invalid or impracticable provision shall be replaced by an appropriate provision that comes as close as possible in terms of
        economic impact to the invalid or unenforceable term.
    </p>
    <p>
        7.2 The contractual relations are exclusively subject to German laws to the exclusion of UN Purchase Law.
    </p>
    <p>
        7.3 For proceedings against Fraunhofer, Fraunhofer’s residence is the place of jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>
        7.4 These usage conditions are valid and came into effect on 01.07.2013.
