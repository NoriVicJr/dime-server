        <div id="_Toc353982704">1. Recording and processing of data in connection with access over the Internet</div>
    </h3>
    <p>
        When you visit our Web site, our Web server makes a temporary record of each access and stores it in a log file. The following data are recorded, and
        stored until an automatic deletion date:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            IP address of the requesting processor
        </li>
        <li>
            Date and time of access
        </li>
        <li>
            Name and URL of the downloaded file
        </li>
        <li>
            Volume of data transmitted
        </li>
        <li>
            Indication whether download was successful
        </li>
        <li>
            Data identifying the browser software and operating system
        </li>
        <li>
            Web site from which our site was accessed
        </li>

        <li>
            Name of your Internet service provider
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The purpose of recording these data is to allow use of the Web site (connection setup), for system security, for technical administration of the network
        infrastructure and in order to optimize our Internet service. The IP address is only evaluated in the event of fraudulent access to the network
        infrastructure of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. Our servers are located in Stuttgart, Germany.

    <h3>
        <div id="_Toc353982705">2. Recording and processing of data when using di.me</div>
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            After registration to the test-server dime.hci.iao.fraunhofer.de , personal data are processed by the system with the only purpose to enable it’s
            function as described in clause 2 of the <div class="linkToUsageTerms">usage conditions</div><. The following data are processed:
        </li>
        <li>
            Your email-address, user ID and password for the registration. By the E-Mail-address we also can contact you in case of dysfunction of the system or to
            send you invitations to a feedback questionnaire for scientific evaluation.
        </li>
        <li>
            A mini-profile for the “di.me user directory” which is visible on the other servers in the di.me decentralized network and which allows other users on
            these servers to contact you in di.me.
        </li>
        <li>
            Data that you provide to the system, e.g. names, pseudonyms, uploaded files or fotos, or contacts from an Android mobile phone. These data are first
            stored on the server dime.hci.iao.fraunhofer.de, but the user can also publish it to other servers by communicating to other users.
        </li>
        <li>
            Data from external systems that you connect to the di.me userware, e.g. profile information and messages from Twitter or LinkedIn in order to show them
            in di.me. If personal data of third persons are connected, the user ensures that they agree to that.
        </li>
        <li>
            Location information from an Android mobile phone if you install the Android application “dime mobile“ and activate the function “Store Android sensor data on your server“  in order to get
            system recommendations to your situation or your place.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You can deactivate your account to the test-system at any time and let your data be deleted by sending us an e-mail with your user ID via the website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apart from the cases explained in clause 1 and 2, no personal data are processed, except that you explicitly agree to further processing. According to the
        explanation on web analysis (see below), pseudonymous use profiles can be recorded.

        <div id="_Toc353982706">3. </div>
        Use and transfer of personal data
    </h3>
    <p>
        All use of your personal data is confined to the purposes stated above, and is only undertaken to the extent necessary for these purposes. Data will not be
        transferred to third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        Personal data will not be transferred to government bodies or public authorities except in order to comply with mandatory national legislation or if the
        transfer of such data should be necessary in order to take legal action in cases of fraudulent access to our network infrastructure. No transfer for any
        other purpose will be done.

    <h3>
        <div id="_Toc353982707">4. Consent to use data in other contexts</div>
    </h3>
    <p>
        The use of certain services on our Web site, such as newsletters or discussion forums, requires prior registration and involves more substantial processing
        of personal data, such as longer-term storage of e-mail addresses, user IDs and passwords. We only use such data insofar as they have been sent to us by
        you in person and you have given us your prior consent for this use.
    </p>
    <h3>
        <div id="_Toc353982708">5. Cookies</div>
    </h3>
    <p>
        We don’t normally use cookies on our Web sites, but in certain exceptional cases we may use cookies which place technical session-control data in your
        browser’s memory. These data contain no references of a personal nature, and are automatically erased when you close your browser.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If, exceptionally, one of our applications requires the storage of personal data in a cookie, for instance a user ID, you will be asked to give your
        consent beforehand.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Of course, it is perfectly possible to consult our Web sites without the use of cookies. Please note, however, that most browsers are programmed to accept
        cookies in their default configuration. You can prevent this by changing the appropriate setting in the browser options. If you set the browser to refuse
        all cookies, this may restrict your use of certain functions on our Web site.
